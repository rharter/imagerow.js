# ImageRow.js

A pure javascript library that sizes rows of images so that they preserve their aspect ratio while filling the row.

## Usage

1. Link the `imagerow.js` and `imagerow.css` files in your site.

```html
<link href="css/imagerow.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="dist/imagerow.js"></script>
```

2. Add image rows to your page.

```html
<section class="image-row">
  <img src="path/to/image1.jpg" />
  <img src="path/to/image2.jpg" />
  <img src="path/to/image2.jpg" />
</section>
```
